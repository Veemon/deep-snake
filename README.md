Latest Experiment: [divergent policies](divergent_policies)

These are a collection of algorithms for learning the game of snake primarily.
Each algorithm is separated into it's own respective directory.

Both [dqn](dqn) and [neat](neat) use an old variant of snake that I wrote. 
That version of snake was primarily meant to be played by a human, thus the code was not organised very well, and no results for those
experiments could be gathered due to the inefficiency of the game. The new experiment [divergent policies](divergent_policies) fixes this by implementing a considerably faster version of snake, and attempts to match the OpenAI Gym API.
